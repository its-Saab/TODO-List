# ToDoLy

ToDoLy is a todo list application via the command-line. The application will allow a user to create new tasks, assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to. Once they are using the application, the user is able to also edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit and save the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored.

## User Interface



```ruby
Welcome to ToDoLy
You have 7 tasks todo and 1 tasks are done!
Pick an option: 
	 1- Show Task List (by date or project)
	 2- Add New Task
	 3- Edit Task (update, mark as done, remove)
	 4- Save and Quit
```
